# CETFind Database Scalability Plan

## Goal

Keep public search predictable as CAP data grows from the current dataset toward 10x–50x its current size, without exposing PostgreSQL or adding infrastructure prematurely.

## Current architecture

- `cutoffs` and `seats` are authoritative historical/source tables.
- `programs` and `institutes` provide normalized metadata.
- `cutoff_trend_points`, `cutoff_college_year_summary`, `cutoff_filter_options`, and `seat_matrix_runtime` are serving/derived tables.
- Public search performs aggregation and pagination in PostgreSQL and only returns the requested page.
- Metadata is cached in the API process.

## Target architecture

```text
CAP PDFs
   |
   v
validated staging/import
   |
   v
authoritative raw tables
   |
   +--> derived-data build --> serving tables
   |                              |
   |                              v
   +--> validation  ----------> publish
                                  |
                                  v
                              public API
                                  |
                                  v
                                users
```

Raw tables remain the source of truth. Public requests should increasingly use purpose-built serving tables rather than recomputing historical aggregates.

## Phase 1 — current / immediate

1. Keep the database private.
2. Keep PostgreSQL-side aggregation and bounded pagination.
3. Keep the 30-second metadata cache.
4. Run `ANALYZE` after successful derived-data rebuilds so planner statistics reflect the new dataset.
5. Measure representative production queries with `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` from inside the private backend network.

## Phase 2 — when raw search becomes the bottleneck

Do not add indexes blindly. Compare the execution plan first.

Candidate serving-table evolution:

- `college_search_summary`: one row per `(program_family, institution_code)` for stable institution metadata and precomputed counts.
- `college_cutoff_points`: compact, query-oriented cutoff points for eligibility lookup when raw `cutoffs` becomes too large.
- Keep trend/seat tables specialized for their existing UI workloads.

The exact columns and indexes for these tables must be derived from real query plans and data cardinalities.

## Phase 3 — indexing

Prefer a small number of indexes that match the real workload. The current `(program_id, percentile, institution_code)` index is a baseline, not a guarantee that it remains optimal at 10x–50x scale.

Every new index must answer:

- Which query uses it?
- How selective is the leading column?
- Does it reduce scanned rows or sorting?
- What storage/write cost does it add?

## Phase 4 — growth testing

Benchmark at approximately:

- 1x current data
- 2x
- 5x
- 10x
- 25x
- 50x

For each level record p50/p95/p99, database execution time, rows scanned/returned, buffer hits/reads, and connection wait.

Representative workloads:

- BBA at percentile 50/80/95
- all cities and a major city
- page 1 and a later page
- each supported course family

## Phase 5 — partitioning

Partitioning is a conditional optimization, not a default. A future `cutoffs` partitioning scheme should only be introduced if query plans and data volume show clear partition-pruning benefits. A year-only partition is not automatically useful because the main public search does not filter by year.

## Phase 6 — infrastructure

Only after query/serving-layer optimization is exhausted:

```text
load balancer
   |
   +-- API instance
   +-- API instance
   +-- API instance
            |
            v
       PostgreSQL
```

On the current free deployment, keep expectations realistic: one API instance is not a multi-instance production cluster.

## Non-negotiable rules

- Never expose PostgreSQL just to obtain an execution plan.
- Never disable public rate limiting for load tests.
- Never create an index solely because a column appears in a WHERE clause.
- Never partition solely because row count increased.
- Never replace authoritative data with a derived table without validation and rollback.
- Benchmark before and after every performance change.
